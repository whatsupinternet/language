tired of having to write separate programs for each language in a desperate attempt to cut through today's attention-deficit fog and reach the average consumer? stop programming for computers and start programming for human beings. use the most modern neural interfacing compiler-safe language known to humankind to directly interface with and implant consumerist impulses directly in the minds of your customers! Language, and all its derivative subsidiary branches targeted at specific racial demogrpahics, is designed to work on a microscopic, biological level, bypassing the inefficient server-screen-vision corridor and targeting your customer base in the most efficient way possible - their minds. Use one of two dynamically typed flavors of Language - written or aural. the syntax is identical, just set a compiler option and let us do the rest. Language guarantees a dynamically-typed, limited-memory, server-safe interface with the human brain, without all the messy parallel-processing work usually needed to manipulate thousands of electrical impulses across a complex biological tissue. we exploit a syntactical channel inherent in the biological structure and compose semantic meaning from arbitrary thoughts and emotions to process data efficiently and directly, without the need for visual design or algorithmic engines. Simply use Language to communicate with another human being. No computers needed. the best progrmaming language. how hard could it be? just talk to another goddamn human being, stop standing there. this isn't programming, you can do this. download our repo, or don't - it doesn't matter. you're probably already using our product. documentation is the whole of human culture. why aren't you better at it? just communicate with another human being. Language does the rest.
